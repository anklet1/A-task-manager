# Reflection: Building with AI Assistance

Working with AI throughout this project reshaped my development workflow in tangible ways. The most immediate impact was speed: AI accelerated scaffolding and closed the gap between intent and implementation. For example, I leaned on the assistant to outline Express route handlers, validation rules using `express-validator`, and model constraints in Mongoose. That freed up mental bandwidth to focus on data flow, UX implications, and edge cases rather than typing boilerplate. The assistant also suggested small but meaningful improvements like environment-driven configuration, deferring server listen during tests, and adding a default JWT secret for test runs.

What worked particularly well was using AI as a “rubber duck” and as a code reviewer. I would describe an intended change—like “add status filtering to the tasks list endpoint”—and the assistant would propose a concise implementation, point out validation and error-handling concerns, and align the API response shape with existing patterns. This back-and-forth clarified intent, surfaced constraints, and often produced a cleaner, more consistent solution. The same applied to testing: generating Jest + Supertest test cases was faster with AI nudging me toward better coverage, realistic payloads, and readable assertions.

Documentation benefitted, too. Drafting the README and revising it iteratively with AI saved time and produced a more structured, audience-friendly document. The assistant helped ensure the README included setup instructions, architectural overview, endpoints, and the AI usage section. It also encouraged adopting conventional commits and showcasing AI workflows explicitly—useful for transparency and reproducibility.

There were limits. First, AI occasionally hallucinated non-existent files or over-generalized from common templates. Guardrails helped: always open files before editing, verify imports, and run tests frequently. Second, context windows matter. If the prompt omitted a crucial constraint (e.g., existing response schema), the assistant might suggest changes misaligned with the codebase. Iterative prompting—providing file snippets, being explicit about invariants, and asking targeted follow-up questions—reduced these misses. Third, while AI can propose architectural patterns, judgment is still required to pick trade-offs that fit project scale, team familiarity, and deployment targets.

I also learned that prompting style significantly affects outcomes. Clear, verb-led requests (“Add optional ?status= filter on GET /api/tasks and keep response shape”) produced crisp diffs. Asking for “review and iterate” encouraged broader feedback across naming, error semantics, and edge cases. When I wanted specific code, I constrained the scope and pasted the relevant function; when I wanted design feedback, I broadened the context and requested pros/cons. This deliberate prompting turned the assistant into a flexible collaborator.

Reviewing AI output is essential. I treated suggestions as proposals, not truth. I checked types, validation, and security assumptions and used tests as the objective arbiter. When tests failed, I asked the assistant to hypothesize causes, propose minimal fixes, and keep responses terse. This loop—generate, run, fix—kept momentum while maintaining quality.

Overall, AI amplified productivity and helped keep the codebase coherent. It excelled at:

- Rapid scaffolding and pattern completion
- Consistency enforcement (naming, responses, validations)
- Test authoring and edge-case enumeration
- Documentation structuring and commit message drafting

It felt limiting when exact project constraints weren’t fully in context, or when low-level environment details (like local DB availability) mattered. The remedy was to explicitly encode these constraints (env variables, NODE_ENV checks, test-safe server bootstrap) and to provide the assistant with real file contents before edits.

The biggest takeaway: AI is most effective when I treat it as a pair programmer with perfect recall of common patterns but imperfect knowledge of my local code. My job is to set the constraints, supply relevant context, and make final decisions. With that contract in place, AI meaningfully improved speed, quality, and developer experience.
